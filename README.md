# Warspear Online Follow Bot
Tired of not having any teammates in this Game to fight a boss? Easy Solution. Be your own Team! This Project is all you need to take quest bosses down. Esspecially here, because you only need 1 Tank Class, 1 Damage Class and a few Healers. See Below.

This Tool got made in a couple of hours. It is in an early stage and is not optimized. Feel free to grab some code partions. I am pretty sure some will copy the Multibox thing, because that alone makes the life easier for so many people playing this game. Having more than 1 Game Instance opened. I would love to see ideas contributed to this POC though as everything merged makes the end product better. And I am not creative enough to come up with features.
## Features it already got:
- Multibox Bypass
- Walk to your Main Character (your "bots" will attack if you are lucky enough when you attack a monster, because they try to walk to where you want to walk).

## Coming Soon (TM) Features
- Auto Heal your Main Character when low.
- Switch to a different mage when Mana is low or there is a cooldown.
- A lot of Optimization / Recoding as this is only a Base Concept
- Create World Routes so you don't have to set-up all your bots into the same room. Not sure if this is even possible. But I mean, the game must know on it's own what room you switch to/enter, right?
- Autofarmer(s). Not sure if I want that as this tool on it's own shouldn't break the economy but only help you fight bosses because of the lack of friendly people/players due to the game dying.

## Already known Issues:
- Interception Sections are Buggy af. The "Bots" will reenter the previous Room and walk to where you would technically stand based on the coords they calculate with. You will need to manually intefer. Don't close the program. Just spam until it switches to the right room and walk a few tiles aways. Then it will get to you on it's own.
